# WinKlang ðŸŽ¶

A simple, modern command-line tool for controlling media players on Windows, inspired by `playerctl`.



---

## About The Project

**WinKlang** is a lightweight, powerful command-line utility for Windows that allows you to control media playback from any application that integrates with the native System Media Transport Controls (SMTC).

Inspired by the simplicity and power of `playerctl` on Linux, WinKlang brings a similar seamless experience to the Windows terminal. Whether you're listening to music on Spotify, watching a video in your browser, or using a desktop media player, WinKlang gives you full control without ever leaving your keyboard.

<!-- ## Key Features

* **Universal Control:** Manage playback (play, pause, next, previous) for all SMTC-compliant applications.
* **Get Metadata:** Instantly retrieve the current track's title, artist, and album.
* **Artwork Support:** Download the album art for the currently playing song.
* **Timeline Info:** Get the current playback position and total duration of the track.
* **Lightweight & Fast:** Built with C# and .NET for a snappy terminal experience. -->
